My personal website ([jasher.io](https://jasher.io)) was created several years ago with [Gatsby v2](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), a static site generator (SSG) / web framework for React. At the time, it was not straight forward to make a proper app out of Gatsby, so I continued looking around for other frameworks. In the meantime, it worked well enough for what I needed for a personal site. 

My eyes were locked onto Svelte. It reminded me of Vue, in the sense that code was much simpler than React, except it took it a step further, even being simpler than Vue. Sapper existed at the time, but wasn't as fleshed out as other alternatives like Next.js, Nuxt, etc. Their newer framework, SvelteKit takes a step in the right direction, but the ecosystem around Svelte isn't as developed as React. 

At some point, I stumbled upon Remix. It seemed to solve most of the issues I had with Svelte frameworks. It was simpler than Next.js / Gatsby, but was still a React framework, so it had the benefit a developed ecosystem. However, it was pay-to-use, with a steep (as a sole developer), $200 price tag. Something I wasn't ready to invest in at the time. Thankfully, it's recently gone open source and I can experiment with it!

So, that's my plan. Develop my personal site using Remix and see what it can do.
